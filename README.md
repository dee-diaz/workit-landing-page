## My process

1. Set up a basic HTML file with the necessary structure for the landing page.

2. Wrote the CSS styles using SASS, which is a CSS preprocessor that makes it easier to write complex stylesheets. SASS allows you to use variables, mixins, and functions, which can simplify the process of writing CSS.

3. Used BEM methodology to structure the CSS. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier and is a naming convention for CSS classes that makes it easier to manage and scale large CSS projects. BEM encourages the use of modular, reusable code and helps to avoid specificity issues.

4. Compiled the SASS code into CSS using a SASS compiler.

5. Linked the compiled CSS file to the HTML file.

6. Tested the landing page to make sure it displays correctly in different browsers and devices.
